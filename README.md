# 👋 Hi there, I'm Letik  
A Roblox scripter and developer focused on creating game systems and clean, scalable architectures.  

*"Good code is the kind that reads like a good book."*  

I believe in building systems that are not only functional but also maintainable, optimized, and enjoyable for other developers to work with.

## 🛠️ **Technical Stack**  

I work with a variety of libraries and frameworks, including:  

- **Resource Management**: Maid / Trove / Janitor  
- **Networking**: Packet, RbxNet  
- **Data Replication**: Replica  
- **Architecture**: custom knit-like structures (or Knit if required)

## 🌟 **My Philosophy**  

I don’t just write scripts — I design systems where every component has a clear purpose, integrates seamlessly, and can evolve as projects grow.  

- 📌 Clean, readable code is always better than quick hacks.  
- 📌 Scalability and optimization are key for long-term projects.  
- 📌 The right tools and frameworks make development faster and more reliable.
